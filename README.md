# Hell ORM

A blocking sqlite ORM for rust.

## Features
- No bullshit: No need for unnecessary async-runtimes or over-complicated migration systems.
- Lightweight: The only dependency is [rusqlite](https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite), thats it.
- Type-safe: Hell ORM leverages the Rust typesystem to produce compile-time errors for invalid operations.
- Easy schemas: Schemas are automatically generated from your models and executed only if needed.
